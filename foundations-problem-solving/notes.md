//First Step
    -> Understand the problem 
  
//Second Step
    -> Plan
    /*  Does your program have a user interface? 
        What will it look like? 
        What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
        What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
        What’s the desired output?
        Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

//Third Step
    ->Pseudocode
        When the user inputs a number
        Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero
        While counter is smaller than user inputted number increment the counter by one
        Print the value of the counter variable

Exercise
--------
Write a program that takes a user’s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz

Pseudocode
When a user inputs a number
Loop from 1 to the entered number
If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
Otherwise print the current number
